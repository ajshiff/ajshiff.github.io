I am able to configure a JSON with an array of objects containing details of the projects I've worked on in the past, then let the program generate an HTML page for me highlighting those projects. I didn't want it to be a one-run-n-done, so I built it to be a command line node program, that anyone can use as long as they configure their ProjectData.json file.",
