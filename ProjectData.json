I am able to configure a JSON with an array of objects containing details of the projects I've worked on in the past, then let the program generate an HTML page for me highlighting those projects. I didn't want it to be a one-run-n-done, so I built it to be a command line node program, that anyone can use as long as they configure their ProjectData.json file.",

        "description": "In Winter 2019 semeter, many university quiz questions were broken with a variety of bugs that rendered the question unanswerable. This tool searches Canvas quiz questions by question type and for certain patterns in quiz questions to identify broken questions. I built the program to have one configurable file that would define all question types to check, and what checks to run on them. This allowed for definitions to be easily updated or added as new issues were found.",

        "description": "I improved the memory efficiency of our team's canvas-link-finder tool by 93%. I also generalized the tool to be able to do more than search links. When put up to the task of searching over 15,000 courses for specific details of items, it only used 600MBs of memory at any given time, compared to the 9GBs the previous tool required. It would run searches on 5000 courses in parallel. I reduced the memory footprint by searching the response data as it is recieved, and only keeping the match data so that irrelevant data would fall out of scope at the earliest point possible.",

        "description": "I saved Pathway Worldwide thousands of dollars by programatically transforming their existing English Connect (EC) Program content from one format into another. When they needed to switch content management systems, their current content format was not suitable to make the trip. I mapped over 7,000 csvs to match the needed format. One of the most difficult parts of this project was editing their HTML snippets to follow their new format and styling standards. This was difficult because many of their HTML snippets each followed different standards, so I needed to define a pattern that was able to standardize 95% of their files.",
